# Object-Tracking-in-Clutter

I implemented three different algorithms for tracking n-objects in clutter environment.

#### Global Nearest Neighbour
More detailed description of this algorithm can be found in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228601003_A_study_of_a_target_tracking_algorithm_using_global_nearest_neighbor_approach).

#### Joint Probabilistic Data Association
More detailed description of this algorithm can be found in this IEEE [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4046781).

#### Multiple Hypothesis Tracking
More detailed description of this algorithm can be found in this IEEE [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1263228).
